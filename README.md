# BrainVisualiser
This is a visualisation tool for making a 3d head out of MRI brain scans using OpenGL and OpenCV  

The main script is BrainVisualizer.py. I have provided a set of preprocessed images from this kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation). You would need to first unzip them because GitHub will not allow for more than 100 files to be uploaded.  
If you would like to see all 110 patient's heads then no problem. I have also provided my preprocessing script which you would need to run before

### Prerequisites
pyopengl, opencv, numpy, PIL
### Example
