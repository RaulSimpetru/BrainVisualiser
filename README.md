# BrainVisualizer
This is a visualization tool for making a 3d head out of MRI brain scans using opengl and opencv  

The main script is BrainVisualizer.py. I have allready provided a set of preprocessed images from the this kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation). If you would like to see all 110 patient's heads then no problem. I have also provided my preprocessing script which you would need to run before

### Prerequisites
pyopengl, opencv, numpy, PIL
